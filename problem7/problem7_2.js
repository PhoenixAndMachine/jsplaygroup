/*

  There are two basic scopes 
    1. Global scope

    2. Function scope
    Javascript has function level scope. This means a variable defined within a function is not accessible outside of it.

/*
  Conclusion:
    1. y1, y2, y3 are global variable
    2. fn has inner variables which are y3, y4
    3. fn can access global varibales y1, y2, y3
    4. y3, y4 in fn can not be accessed outside of fn
    5. y3 in fn is different from y3 in global scope
